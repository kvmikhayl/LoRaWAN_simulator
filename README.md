# LoRaWAN_simulator

The simulator allows modelling a multi-GW LoRaWAN GW and has been collbaboratively developed by Riccardo Marini (University of Bologna, Italy), Konstantin Mikhaylov(University of Oulu, Finland), Gianni Pasolini(University of Bologna, Italy) and Chiara Buratti(University of Bologna, Italy). The simulator has been used and further detailed in the paper 
Marini, R.; Mikhaylov, K.; Pasolini, G.; Buratti, C. LoRaWANSim: A Flexible Simulator for LoRaWAN Networks. Sensors 2021, 21, 695. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21030695 
which is openly avialable from: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/3/695/htm
We would appreciate a reference to this paper, should you use this simulator :)
